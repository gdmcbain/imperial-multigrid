#### Lecture Series at Imperial College
Luke Olson, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign

**W May 06 2020, 4--6pm BST**

The focus of this lecture series is on the fundamentals of multigrid methods
and is open to both practitioners and methods developers in mathematics, computer
science, and the applied sciences. The lecture series will cover the basics of
multigrid methods in both a geometric and algebraic setting, introduce some key
concepts in the theoretical treatment of these methods, and highlight their use
in a parallel setting.

*Suggested prerequisites: strong background in linear algebraic and some
exposure to linear solvers; basic Python experience (for examples, but not
required); general numerical analysis; introductory knowledge of partial
differential equations.*
